# MOSAC Logging Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The user reported that while the new enhanced EnergyNet logging was working, the standard MOSAC logging (alpha curves, loss curves) was not visible in TensorBoard.

## Root Causes Found
1. **Low logging frequency**: Standard metrics were only logged every 100 training steps
2. **Missing data flushing**: TensorBoard writer wasn't explicitly flushed during training
3. **No proper cleanup**: TensorBoard writer wasn't properly closed at training end

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Increased Logging Frequency
**File**: `multi_objective_sac.py`
**Change**: Line 535
```python
# BEFORE: Logged every 100 steps
if self.tensorboard_log and self.training_step % 100 == 0:

# AFTER: Log every 10 steps for better granularity
if self.tensorboard_log and self.training_step % 10 == 0:
```

### 2. Added Explicit Data Flushing
**File**: `multi_objective_sac.py`
**Changes**: 
- Line 550: Added `self.writer.flush()` after training metrics logging
- Line 885: Added `agent.writer.flush()` after episode metrics logging

### 3. Added Logger Cleanup Method
**File**: `multi_objective_sac.py`
**Addition**: New method in MultiObjectiveSAC class
```python
def close_logger(self):
    """Close TensorBoard logger and flush all remaining data."""
    if hasattr(self, 'writer') and self.writer is not None:
        self.writer.flush()
        self.writer.close()
        if self.verbose:
            print("TensorBoard logger closed and data flushed")
```

### 4. Proper Training Cleanup
**File**: `multi_objective_sac.py`
**Addition**: Line 919 in `train_mo_sac()` function
```python
# Close logger to ensure all data is flushed
agent.close_logger()
```

### 5. Improved Alpha Metric Name
**File**: `multi_objective_sac.py`
**Change**: Line 539
```python
# BEFORE: Potential name conflict
self.writer.add_scalar('Alpha', self.get_alpha(), self.training_step)

# AFTER: Clear namespace separation
self.writer.add_scalar('Training/Alpha', self.get_alpha(), self.training_step)
```

## Expected Results

With these fixes, TensorBoard should now show:

### Standard MOSAC Metrics (every 10 training steps):
- `Loss/Critic` - Critic network loss
- `Loss/Actor` - Actor network loss  
- `Loss/Alpha` - Alpha parameter loss (if auto-tuning)
- `Training/Alpha` - Alpha parameter value

### Episode Metrics (every episode):
- `Episode/Reward_Objective_0` - First objective reward
- `Episode/Reward_Objective_1` - Second objective reward
- `Episode/Length` - Episode length
- `Episode/Scalarized_Reward` - Weighted combination of objectives

### Enhanced EnergyNet Metrics:
- `EnergyNet_Step/*` - All 20 info dict entries per step
- `EnergyNet_Episode/*` - Statistical aggregations per episode
- `EnergyNet_Eval/*` - Evaluation episode statistics

## Validation

The fixes were tested with:
1. **test_complete_logging.py** - Comprehensive test script
2. Verified TensorBoard event file creation
3. Confirmed proper data flushing and cleanup

## Usage

No changes required for existing training scripts. The enhanced logging and fixes are automatically applied when:
- `tensorboard_log` parameter is set in MultiObjectiveSAC
- Training runs with the updated code

## Viewing Results

```bash
tensorboard --logdir /path/to/your/logs
```

All metric categories should now be visible and properly updated during training.
