# SAC PCS Training Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented and fixed a complete SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) training system for PCS (Power Control Strategy) agents in the EnergyNet environment.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. SACPCSAgent Class (`EnergyNetMoISO/pcs_models/sac_pcs_agent.py`)
- Complete SAC implementation with all optimizations from multi-objective SAC
- Inherits from `GenericPCSAgent` for compatibility with ISO training
- Includes the following optimizations:
  - Learning rate annealing (cosine, linear, exponential)
  - Reward scaling/normalization
  - Orthogonal weight initialization
  - Value function clipping
  - Automatic entropy tuning
- Actor-critic architecture with experience replay
- GPU/CPU compatibility

### 2. Training Script (`training/sac_pcs_training.py`)
- Complete training loop for SAC PCS agents on PCSUnitEnv
- Support for loading trained ISO models
- Comprehensive argument parsing for all hyperparameters
- Progress tracking and evaluation
- Model checkpointing and saving
- TensorBoard logging
- JSON results export

### 3. SLURM Training Scripts
- `run_train_sac_pcs.sh`: Single training runs
- `run_train_sac_pcs_multiseed.sh`: Multi-seed training for statistical significance
- Full SLURM integration with proper error handling
- Environment variable support for optimization features
- Automatic model and results management

## Key Features

### Environment Support
- **PCS Unit Environment**: Direct training on PCSUnitEnv
- **ISO Model Integration**: Can load and use trained ISO models during training
- **Observation/Action Spaces**: Automatically detects environment dimensions

### Optimization Features
All optimizations from the multi-objective SAC are available:
- **Learning Rate Annealing**: `ENABLE_LR_ANNEALING=true`
- **Reward Scaling**: `ENABLE_REWARD_SCALING=true` 
- **Orthogonal Initialization**: `ENABLE_ORTHOGONAL_INIT=true`
- **Value Clipping**: `ENABLE_VALUE_CLIPPING=true`
- **All at once**: `ENABLE_ALL_OPTIMIZATIONS=true`

### Training Configuration
- Customizable network architectures
- Flexible hyperparameter tuning
- Multiple evaluation strategies
- Checkpoint and best model saving

## Usage Examples

### Basic Training
```bash
sbatch -c 4 --gres=gpu:1 run_train_sac_pcs.sh experiment_name 500000
```

### Training with ISO Model
```bash
sbatch -c 4 --gres=gpu:1 run_train_sac_pcs.sh pcs_with_iso 500000 3e-4 /path/to/iso_model.pth 42
```

### Training with Optimizations
```bash
ENABLE_ALL_OPTIMIZATIONS=true \
sbatch -c 4 --gres=gpu:1 run_train_sac_pcs.sh optimized_pcs 1000000
```

### Multi-seed Training
```bash
sbatch -c 4 --gres=gpu:1 run_train_sac_pcs_multiseed.sh baseline_study 500000
```

## Results

The SAC PCS agent successfully:
- ✅ Imports and initializes correctly in SLURM environment
- ✅ Trains on PCSUnitEnv with proper state/action dimensions (4D state, 1D action)
- ✅ Loads and uses trained ISO models from multi-objective SAC
- ✅ Supports all optimization features
- ✅ Saves models and results properly
- ✅ Provides comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Integration with ISO Training

The `SACPCSAgent` inherits from `GenericPCSAgent`, making it compatible for use as a PCS policy during ISO training:

```python
# Train PCS agent
pcs_agent = SACPCSAgent(...)
pcs_agent.train(...)

# Use in ISO training
iso_env = MultiObjectiveISOEnv(trained_pcs_model=pcs_agent)
```

## Fixed Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Fixed Python path setup in SLURM environment
2. **Argument Parsing**: Corrected command-line argument order
3. **Environment Registration**: Proper handling of energy_net package imports
4. **Path Resolution**: SLURM job directory handling
5. **Multi-objective SAC Import**: Correct module path resolution

## Testing

All components tested successfully:
- ✅ Local training runs
- ✅ SLURM batch job execution  
- ✅ Import verification
- ✅ Model loading/saving
- ✅ GPU/CPU compatibility
- ✅ ISO model integration

The implementation is now ready for full-scale training experiments on PCS units with optional ISO model integration.
